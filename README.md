## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project utilizes default packages within the Anaconda distribution of Python for the majority of the analysis.

However, you will need to install yellowbrick if you haven't already done so before. See [For More Information](https://pypi.org/project/yellowbrick/).

The code is tested using Python versions 3.7.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, We are mainly driven by the below questions for our analysis:

Q1. How the availability of listings and price vary over the course of the year?
Q2. Explore monthly price variation over the course of the year in greater depth
Q3. Price Influencers
Feature Selection Using Univariate Analysis
Feature Selection Using Recursive Feature Elimination
Q4. Build Two Linear Regression Models using the selected features and compare their performance.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to address the questions above.


Most of the analysis is carried out using calendar.csv and  listings.csv files, which were downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://lgreddy-sbn.medium.com/analysing-the-seattle-airbnb-datasets-4cef9b2f9dc1).
